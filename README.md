# Tweeather

Tweeather is a Machine Learning project that correlates Twitter sentiment to European weather.

I was inspired by a study where user behaviour on Twitter was used to build a predictive model of income: [Studying
User Income through Language, Behaviour and Affect in Social Media][1]. I decided it was the perfect opportunity to venture into the world of Big Data and so I learned Spark and Hadoop.

## Requirements

You need these tools to be able to run the project:

- Java 1.7+
- [scala-sbt][7]

And these clusters:

- [Apache Spark 1.6][6] (required for everything)
- [HDFS][8] (required only for multi-machine Spark clusters)

And the following hardware:

- one or more machines
	- preferably a single, powerful one so you don't need Hadoop
- at least 16GB of RAM
	- it should work with less, but make sure you edit the `executorHighMem` size in `SparkSubmit.scala` â€“ see [Setup](#setup)
- at least 8 logical cores
	- it should work with less, but the more you have the better/faster scripts will run
	- to run the Collector scripts, you need to have at least `<number of Twitter apps> + 1` cores

## Setup

### Configuration

The project has 2 configuration files:

- `src/main/resources/com/aluxian/tweeather/res/twitter.properties`
	- used to provide Twitter credentials for the Collector scripts
- `src/main/resources/com/aluxian/tweeather/res/log4j.properties`
	- used to configure logging

Make sure you copy and configure these before running the scripts:

```
$ cp src/main/resources/com/aluxian/tweeather/res/log4j-template.properties \
	src/main/resources/com/aluxian/tweeather/res/log4j.properties
$ cp src/main/resources/com/aluxian/tweeather/res/twitter-template.properties \
	src/main/resources/com/aluxian/tweeather/res/twitter.properties
```

### Env vars

Make sure you set these up before running a script:

- `TW_SPARK_MASTER`
	- a url to a Spark master to connect to
	- if not specified, scripts will run on `local[*]`
	- by default, scripts will run in `client` deploy mode

### System properties

Tweeather supports the following custom system properties:

- `tw.streaming.timeout`
	- the period, in seconds, after which streaming should stop
	- default: *unlimited*
- `tw.streaming.interval`
	- the duration, in seconds, for each streaming batch
	- default: *5 minutes*

### Submit tasks

If your Spark cluster doesn't have at least 14GB of RAM, edit `executorHighMem` in `project/SparkSubmit.scala`.

## Scripts

The project has 3 sets of scripts.

### 1. *Sentiment140* scripts

I used these scripts to train a naive Bayes sentiment analyser with the [Sentiment140][2] dataset. Nothing fancy here. The resulting model has an accuracy of 80%.

#### Processing

The same processing steps were taken as for the [*Emo* scripts](#2-emo-scripts).

#### Running

To run the experiment:

```
# Download the datasets
$ sbt submit-Sentiment140Downloader

# Parse the datasets
$ sbt submit-Sentiment140Parser

# Train the sentiment analyser
$ sbt submit-Sentiment140Trainer

# Test the analyser
$ sbt submit-Sentiment140Repl
```

### Example

Here's an example of prediction done on the Sentiment140 test dataset:

### 2. *Emo* scripts

I used these scripts to train a naive Bayes sentiment analyser with tweets collected by myself. The resulting model had an accuracy of 75% and is available for download in the [downloads section](#downloads).

#### Collection

For collecting the tweets, I used [Twitter's Streaming API][3] with multiple apps configured. The average throughput was of 325 tweets/sec and I collected over 100M tweets in 4 days. However, after removing all the duplicates, only 8.4M remained.

The stream of tweets I received from the Twitter API was filtered by emoji characters. Tweets that contained positive emojis like :grin: were classified as positive, and tweets that contained negative emojis like :cry: were classified as negative. Tweets that contained both types of emojis were excluded.

This method allowed me to gather a fairly large dataset of labelled tweets, while the accuracy of the model didn't seem to suffer.

#### Processing

Before training the analyser, the tweets were pre-processed:

- the feature space was reduced
  - urls were replaced with `URL`
  - `@username` mentions were replaced with `USERNAME`
  - repeated letters were replaced with just 2 occurrences of the letter
- text was sanitized
  - punctuation was removed
  - multiple white spaces were replaced with just one
- stop words like "not", "is", "less", and "or" were removed

#### Training

I used 90% of the tweets for training and the remaining 10% for testing.

#### Running

To run the experiment:

```
# Collect tweets; leave this running for a few hours
$ sbt submit-TwitterHoseEmoCollector

# Parse the collected tweets
$ sbt submit-TwitterHoseEmoParser

# Train the sentiment analyser
$ sbt submit-TwitterHoseEmoTrainer

# Test the analyser
$ sbt submit-TwitterHoseEmoRepl
```

#### Screenshot

Here's a screenshot of my collector running for almost 4 days.

#### Sentiment across Europe

I collected tweets geo-localised in Europe created between 2015-12-26 and 2016-12-04. I ran them through the sentiment analyser, and this is the result:

![Happiness Levels in Europe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aluxian/Tweeather/master/docs/happiness.gif)

The change in the number of data points seems to depend more on the time of day than on weather conditions. In order to draw a pertinent conclusion about the correlation between weather conditions and sentiment, a larger dataset of tweets is required (spread across more than just a week).

### 3. *Fire* scripts

I used these scripts to train an [artificial neural network][5] that predicted the sentiment polarity given 3 weather variables: temperature, pressure and humidity.

#### Collection

Tweets were collected using Twitter's Streaming API, filtered by location (Europe) and language (English).

#### Processing

After they were collected, tweets were ran through the sentiment analyser to get their polarity. The parser script used a [NOAA][4]-provided [weather dataset][17] to extract the temperature, pressure and humidity for each tweet's location.

#### Training

After processing the tweets, I used them to train a [multilayer perceptron][9]. The 3 weather variables were the input nodes and the polarity was the output node. 90% of the dataset was used for training and the remaining 10% for testing.

#### Running

To run the experiment:

```
# Collect tweets; leave this running for a few hours
$ sbt submit-TwitterHoseFireCollector

# Parse the collected tweets
# This parser uses the "emo" sentiment analyser, make sure
#   you've trained it first or edit the script to use the other model
$ sbt submit-TwitterHoseFireParser

# Train the sentiment analyser
$ sbt submit-TwitterHoseFireTrainer

# Test the analyser
$ sbt submit-TwitterHoseFireRepl
```

#### Screenshot

Here's a screenshot of my collector running for almost 9 days.

![Fire Collector](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aluxian/Tweeather/master/docs/ss-fire-collector.png)

## Conclusion

> TODO

## Tips

Keep these in mind:

- use a powerful machine (otherwise, a cluster might be required)
- use the Spark UI to watch your script's progress on [http://localhost:4040](http://localhost:4040)
- you can download my trained models from the [downloads section](#downloads); just place them where the trainers would save them (see the scripts' source code) and you're good to go

## Suggestions

A few suggestions to improve the project:

- The sentiment analyser doesn't recognise negated words. Sentences like "i am not happy" are incorrectly classified as positive. Use a POS-tagger to merge words with their negations before using them for training (e.g. that sentence would become "i am not_happy")
- Use fuzzy matching with an English dictionary to correct spelling mistakes and further reduce the feature space
- *Other suggestions are welcome!*
