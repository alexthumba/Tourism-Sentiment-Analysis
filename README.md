# Tourism-Sentiment-Analysis

This is a masters thesis project to study sentiment analysis in the context of tourism.

I was inspired by a project Thweeather that correlates twitter sentiments to european weather. I modified the code of that project to analyze tweets related to tourism and I plan to predict the best places to visit at a particular time of year.
