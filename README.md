# Tourism-Sentiment-Analysis

This is a masters thesis project to study sentiment analysis of twitter for tourism recommendation.

The project is built on top of another project "Thweeather" that correlates twitter sentiments to european weather. The project repository of Tweeather is https://github.com/Aluxian/Tweeather. I modified the code of that project and added new scripts to analyze tweets related to tourism. First, my goal is to deduce if Twitter is an apt source for tourism recommendation. Second, I study sentiment analysis and apply it on tourism related tweets to show sentiments of tourists in different countries. Third, I try to gather other tourism related data from the tweets that can be useful for travel agencies, tourism operators and tourists.

This is an ongoing master's thesis and I plan to complete it in November 2016.
